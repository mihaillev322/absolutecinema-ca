<h1>About Civic Drought Desk and our drought data standards</h1>
</header>
<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Mission and audience</h2>
<p>Civic Drought Desk exists to make <strong>US drought</strong> information accessible, understandable, and actionable for everyday readers. Our primary audience includes households, small business owners, community organizations, local journalists, and anyone seeking to understand <strong>water risk</strong> without wading through technical jargon or fragmented data sources. We believe that informed communities make better decisions about <strong>water conservation</strong>, emergency preparedness, and long-term resilience planning.</p>
<p>The challenge with <strong>drought data</strong> is not scarcity but fragmentation. Federal agencies, state water boards, university researchers, and nonprofit organizations all produce valuable information, but finding and interpreting that information requires time and expertise most people lack. Civic Drought Desk bridges this gap by curating, summarizing, and contextualizing drought information in plain language while always pointing readers back to primary sources for verification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Access to reliable water information should not require a hydrology degree. Our goal is to lower the barrier between expert data and public understanding, empowering communities to engage meaningfully with drought as a shared challenge."</p>
<cite>— Civic Drought Desk editorial principles</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>We focus specifically on <strong>drought conditions</strong> affecting the United States, though we recognize that drought is a global phenomenon with interconnected causes and consequences. Climate patterns, agricultural trade, and water policy decisions in one region can affect water availability elsewhere. For readers interested in the broader science of water systems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia's hydrology article</a> provides an accessible introduction to the water cycle and its study.</p>
<p>Our coverage emphasizes practical relevance. We explain what drought categories mean for real-world impacts, how to find local data, and what steps households and small organizations can take to reduce vulnerability. We do not provide emergency management guidance, issue official warnings, or replace consultation with local authorities. Instead, we help readers understand the landscape of drought information so they can engage more effectively with official communications and local planning processes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer">USGS Water Resources Mission Area</a> conducts foundational research on water availability, quality, and use across the nation. Their work underpins much of the data we reference and summarize. Similarly, <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOAA</a> provides climate monitoring, drought forecasting, and coordination services that inform both our content and the broader drought response community.</p>
<p>We encourage readers to explore our <a href="/">Home briefing hub</a> for current drought context and our <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for answers to common questions about drought categories, restrictions, and data sources.</p>

<summary>Who produces Civic Drought Desk content?</summary>
<p>Civic Drought Desk content is produced by researchers and writers with backgrounds in environmental science, public policy, and science communication. We are not affiliated with any government agency, water utility, or advocacy organization. Our funding comes from reader support and does not influence our editorial decisions. We maintain independence to ensure our summaries remain objective and focused on public benefit rather than commercial or political interests.</p>

<section id="standards" class="content-section">
<h2>Editorial standards and verification</h2>
<p>Our source hierarchy prioritizes federal and state government agencies as primary authorities for <strong>drought data</strong> and official classifications. The US Drought Monitor, NOAA/NIDIS, USGS, EPA, and Bureau of Reclamation provide the empirical foundation for our briefings. State water agencies and drought task forces offer regional specificity that federal sources may lack. University research programs contribute scientific context, methodological insights, and emerging findings that help explain observed patterns.</p>
<p>We distinguish between "confirmed" information and "context." Confirmed information comes directly from authoritative sources with clear methodology and institutional accountability—official drought classifications, measured streamflow data, published reservoir levels. Context includes explanatory material, historical comparisons, and interpretive framing that helps readers understand confirmed data. We clearly attribute both types of content and provide links for independent verification.</p>
<p>Major news outlets may be cited for context when they report on drought impacts, policy responses, or community experiences. However, we do not rely on news coverage as a primary source for hydrological data or drought classifications. News reports are useful for understanding how drought affects people and communities but should be verified against official sources for technical accuracy.</p>
<p>Corrections are handled transparently. When we identify errors in our summaries—whether factual mistakes, broken links, or outdated information—we update the affected page and add a dated correction note. Static pages reflect conditions at the time of publication; we encourage readers to check publication dates and verify current conditions with official sources before making decisions based on our content.</p>

<h2>Scope and limitations</h2>
<details>
<summary>Not emergency management</summary>
<p>Civic Drought Desk does not provide emergency management guidance, issue evacuation orders, or replace official warnings from local authorities. During drought emergencies, follow instructions from your county emergency management office, state health department, and municipal water utility. Our role is to provide background context and help readers understand drought information—not to direct emergency response. If you face an immediate water emergency, contact local authorities rather than relying on our content.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Local variability</summary>
<p>Drought conditions vary significantly at local scales. A county-level drought classification may not reflect conditions in your specific neighborhood, watershed, or water service area. Microclimates, local water infrastructure, and community-specific factors all influence actual water availability. Our briefings provide regional context, but readers should consult local sources—municipal utilities, county extension offices, neighborhood associations—for conditions specific to their location.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Data lag and revisions</summary>
<p>Drought data involves inherent time lags. The US Drought Monitor reflects conditions as of the Tuesday before each Thursday release. Streamflow and groundwater data may have delays ranging from hours to days depending on the monitoring network. Historical data is sometimes revised as quality control processes identify errors or new information becomes available. Our summaries reflect data available at publication time; conditions may have changed since then.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to suggest a source</summary>
<p>We welcome suggestions for authoritative sources we may have overlooked. If you know of a government agency, university program, or established organization producing reliable drought or water data that we should consider, please contact us with the source name, URL, and a brief description of what it offers. We evaluate suggested sources against our editorial standards before incorporating them into our coverage. We cannot guarantee inclusion but appreciate reader input in improving our source base.</p>
